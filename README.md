I was working through Daniel Shiffman's The Nature of Code and wanted to try making a genetic algorithm.

###### Cars are made from two arrays of DNA that carry instructions for each frame of animation:
- Pedal DNA: Tells the car wether to hit the gas pedal, do nothing, or brake.
- Wheel DNA: Tells the car to rotate the wheel by a certain angle.
